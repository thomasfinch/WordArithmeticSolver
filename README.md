#Word Arithmetic Solver

The word arithmetic solver program  takes word arithmetic problems and solves them by guessing randomly. A word arithmetic problem is something like JITTER/JOB = TOP, where each letter represents one digit 0-9. A solution can usually be guessed in under 10,000 tries ( < 5 seconds). 

An example of how to use the program can be seen here:
